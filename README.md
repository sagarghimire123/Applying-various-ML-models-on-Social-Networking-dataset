# Applying-various-ML-models-on-Social-Networking-dataset

### This project is basically about apply various ML models and get the best model out of all applied. The data set is very small with 400 rows which seems like a sampple data. Initially we are applying EDA no feature engineering is required here since there are only 3 columns.

### After we are done with EDA we are applying various ML models such as Logistic, Knn,DT and R-forest models. For this process `we are performing grid search and hyper parameter tunning to improve the performance of each models.
